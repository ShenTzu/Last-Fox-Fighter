The Last Fox Fighter is a top down twinstick shooter set in the universe of my other game, Fuchian Chronicles. Fight increasingly difficult swarms of drones and powerful capital ships, all the while upgrading your fighter with improved stats and abilities to improve your odds. I built it using Godot over a 8 month period from April 2024 to December 2024.

Currently this is a work in progress. This repository will contain some scripts from the game as a way to demonstrate my coding abilities and thought process, as well as notes on my personal design decisions and thoughts on room for improvement.

## Why?
I had previously made several games using RPGMaker MV, and after completing my latest project, Fuchian Chronicles, wanted to grow as a game developer and make games with more interesting gameplay than what's doable in RPGMaker. I have some previous experience with both GameMaker Studio and Godot, and ultimately decided to delve deeper into Godot as it has more potential with its ability to make both 2D and 3D games. The Last Fox Fighter is my first major project with the engine, and aims to push my game design and programming abilities with its fast-paced action driven gameplay as opposed to the slower narrative driven games I made before.

## Quick Start
A web-playable demo is available on [itch.io](https://shentzu.itch.io/the-last-fox-fighter), while the full version is available for $1 on itch.io, or as free DLC for owners of my other game, Fuchian Chronicles, on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1789050/Fuchian_Chronicles/).
